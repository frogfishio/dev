4. If you you have it already setup choose Frogfish Knona development environment as runtime image

If you don't have it set up then you can choose just generic Ubuntu then in your repository just replace the .devcontainer folder with what is in this repository and rebuild your container from the remote menu (lower-left)

## Troubleshooting

To connect to private repos you'll need SSH keys set up

1. Make sure you're running as an Administrator
Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent
Get-Service ssh-agent

2. ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/github_rsa or whatever your key is. You might have to fiddle with .ssh/config file if you have multiple keys for different domains
